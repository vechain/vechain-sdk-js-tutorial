# The VeChain SDK JS Tutorial

_This tutorial is a work in progress._

The goal of the tutorial is to teach how to develop a 'dapp' based on Thor using the VeChain SDK for JS.

The [src](src) directory provides a list of exercises with their solutions, so far

* [Hello World!](src/Exercise1.ts)
* [The Bloom filter.](src/Exercise2.ts)
* [The Bloom filter: advanced topics on `k` and `m` parameters.](src/Exercise3.ts) 
* [User's keys and address.](src/Exercise4.mts)
* [User's keys and address from mnemonic words.](src/Exercise5.ts)

The exercises have explanations between `/* remarks */` then a number of ` // STEP <n>: ` ask and suggest what to do.
Below each step, a proposed solutions is marked out as `//` remarks, if you wish remove the remarks and poke the code to play.
